# Alert
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 200. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*

You gain the following benefits.

**Initiative Proficiency.** When you roll [Initiative](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md), you can add your [Proficiency Bonus](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) to the roll.

**Initiative Swap.** Immediately after you roll [Initiative](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md), you can swap your [Initiative](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) with the [Initiative](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) of one willing ally in the same combat. You can't make this swap if you or the ally has the [Incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.`;
