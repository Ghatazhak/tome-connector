/**
 * A ratchet on the functions that are already too long: they may shrink, and they may not grow.
 *
 * The sibling of `verify-file-sizes.mjs`, for `max-lines-per-function`. Five functions were over
 * the 50-line limit when this was added, so switching the rule on in `eslint.config.mts` would
 * either have failed the build outright or arrived with five disables attached - a rule defeated
 * before it ran. A baseline lets it go on now and hold the line, instead of waiting on five
 * refactors that were never going to be scheduled.
 *
 * It earned that immediately: `findSendables` was written at 67 lines in the same session and the
 * ratchet refused it, so it was split rather than baselined.
 *
 * **The rule is enabled here rather than in the shared config**, deliberately. `npm run lint` runs
 * eslint with `--max-warnings=0`; a rule that five functions violate cannot live there until they
 * are fixed. This script turns it on for its own run, so the policy is enforced without making the
 * ordinary lint pass unusable. When the last baseline entry goes, move the rule into the config and
 * delete this file.
 *
 * The comparison is `ratchet.mjs`, shared with the file-size script and tested in
 * `tests/ratchet.test.ts`.
 *
 * ESLint does the counting. Reimplementing function-boundary detection and the rule's
 * `skipBlankLines`/`skipComments` semantics would give two numbers that disagree at the edges, and
 * the one in the error message would be the one nobody could reproduce.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/verify-function-sizes.mjs            # check (what `npm run lint` runs)
 *   node scripts/verify-function-sizes.mjs --update   # record the current sizes
