 * notes reserve `#` for a title they never write and start at `##`, and a
 * source that skips a level (`##` then `####`) is common too. Either would
 * leave a gap that the outline generator renders as a missing or misplaced
 * node. So each heading's *true depth in the note's own tree* is recovered
 * with a stack first, and that is what gets offset.
 *
 * Levels beyond `maxLevel` are clamped rather than dropped, which flattens
 * the tail of a deeply nested outline instead of losing those entries.
