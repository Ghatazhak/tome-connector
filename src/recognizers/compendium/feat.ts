 * The feat's category, read out of its prerequisite.
 *
 * `Srd2024Feat.Type` is what lets a level 1 character be offered a different list
 * from a level 4 one, so a feat without it is a feat the builder cannot place.
 * The CLI does not state it - every feat is tagged `ttrpg-cli/feat` and nothing
 * else - but it does not need to, because in the 2024 rules the category *is* the
 * prerequisite:
 *
 * | Prerequisite            | Type           |
 * |-------------------------|----------------|
 * | (none)                  | Origin         |
 * | `4th`                   | General        |
 * | `19th`                  | Epic Boon      |
 * | mentions Fighting Style | Fighting Style |
 *
 * That is a reading of what the source says, not an inference from what it omits,
 * and on the 2024 Player's Handbook it partitions exactly: 43 General, 12 Epic
 * Boon, 12 Fighting Style, and the 10 with no prerequisite are precisely the ten
 * origin feats the book lists.
 *
 * The level check is a word-boundary match on the ordinal so that "Level 2 Ranger
 * Fighting Style" - one of the two long-form fighting style prerequisites - is not
 * read as a General feat. Fighting Style is therefore tested first.
 *
 * @param is2024
 *   Whether the note came from a 2024 book. **The no-prerequisite rule is only
 *   true there.** Origin feats do not exist in the 2014 rules, where a feat is
 *   just a feat and none of them carries a level prerequisite - so applying the
 *   table to a 2014 vault files Dungeon Delver, Linguist and Martial Adept as
 *   origin feats and offers them to a level 1 character. A vault built from the
 *   whole `ttrpg-convert-cli` source map holds both editions at once, so this is
 *   the ordinary case rather than an edge one. Anything not from 2024 gets no
 *   category, which means the builder does not offer it at all - the right answer
 *   for a 2014 feat in a 2024 character builder, and a visible absence rather
 *   than a silent misplacement.
