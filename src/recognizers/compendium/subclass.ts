/**
 * Turns a `ttrpg-convert-cli` subclass note into a patch for its parent class.
 *
 * **Subclasses, not classes.** All twelve base classes in a generated compendium are
 * SRD content, which Tome already ships with its level tables, features and spell
 * progressions intact. What a conversion actually adds is the other thirty-six
 * subclasses - the ones the SRD does not license, one per class being all it allows.
 * So this reads a subclass and leaves the class alone.
 *
 * That is also what avoids the worst parse in the corpus. A class note states its
 * progression as an HTML table with malformed attributes (`<td class"level">`), empty
 * cells written as U+23E4, and value columns identified only by position - and a
 * misread row silently gives a character the wrong spell slots. A **subclass** states
 * everything twice: once in that table, and once as `### Feature Name (Level 3)`
 * headings. All 261 feature headings in the reference corpus carry the level, without
 * exception, so this reads the headings and never opens the table.
 *
 * Pure and `obsidian`-free.
