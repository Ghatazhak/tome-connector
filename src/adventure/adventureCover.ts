 * `ttrpg-convert-cli` output does not have a fixed cover convention - most
 * adventures in the corpus carry no such file at all - but some books ship
 * one literally named `cover.webp` or `*-banner*.webp` inside their `img/`
 * folder, embedded near the top of the first chapter. That filename is
 * checked first because it is a stronger signal than anything guessed from
 * document order.

 * <para>
 * Falling back to a random pick rather than always the first image: the
 * first picture in a book is not reliably its best one, and a fixed choice
 * would make every book from a folder full of near-identical floorplans
 * default to whichever happens to sort first. Battle maps are excluded from
 * that random pool where a non-map alternative exists - a dungeon floorplan
 * is a poor book cover next to any piece of scene art - but a cover-named
 * file wins outright even if it happens to also look like a map.
