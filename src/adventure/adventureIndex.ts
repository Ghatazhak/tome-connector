/**
 * Reads a `ttrpg-convert-cli` adventure folder's index note, or falls back to
 * filename order for a hand-authored folder that has none.
 *
 * **Filename order is wrong for chapters, in general.** `10-epilogue.md` sorts
 * before `2-goblin-arrows.md` on every filesystem, so a folder listing cannot
 * give the reading order on its own. The index note the CLI writes alongside
 * every adventure states it explicitly - `# Index of <Title>` followed by one
 * link per chapter, in the right order - which is why it is read at all
 * rather than just globbing the folder.
 *
 * A hand author has no reason to know that format exists, so
 * {@link orderByFilenamePrefix} recovers the same ordering from a leading
 * number - `01 - `, `02.`, `03)` - which *is* discoverable: it is what a
 * person reaches for unprompted when a folder needs a reading order at all.
 *
 * Pure and `obsidian`-free.
