/**
 * Turns one chapter file's worth of `ttrpg-convert-cli` markdown into scenes,
 * and a whole adventure folder into a plan.
 *
 * **The room-promotion rule.** A chapter's `##` sections each become a scene,
 * but a numbered room can be buried several headings deeper - `## Area 1` >
 * `### The Approach` > `#### B1: Guard Post`. `extractRooms` pulls every
 * heading whose text passes {@link asRoomHeading} out to its own sibling
 * scene, however deep it sits, and removes that heading's own text from
 * whichever section used to contain it - `parseSections` in
 * `labelledMarkdown.ts` deliberately gives a parent its children's text, so
 * without this cut every room's prose would appear twice: once under the area
 * heading, once under its own.
 *
 * Correct for a published dungeon crawl, and a surprise for someone who just
 * numbered a heading by hand - `ChapterSource.promoteRooms` (read from a
 * chapter note's `tome_room_promotion` frontmatter by `adventureVault.ts`,
 * true unless set to `false`) is the opt-out. `parseChapter` skips
 * `extractRooms` entirely when it is off, so a numbered heading stays exactly
 * where it was written.
 *
 * Entity and image resolution is intentionally shallow here. `tomeName`
 * starts as the link's own display text, which is what the adventure's prose
 * already shows the GM; `adventureVault.ts` overwrites it with the target
 * note's real statblock name (and downgrades an `items/*` link that turns out
 * not to be magic to `skip`) once it has actually read the note - this module
 * never touches the vault, which is what keeps it testable with a fixture.
 *
 * Pure and `obsidian`-free.
